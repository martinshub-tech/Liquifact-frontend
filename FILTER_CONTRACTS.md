# Filter Contracts

This document outlines the expected data shapes and processing complexities for the `useInvoiceFilters` hook, which powers the Liquifact Marketplace searching, filtering, and sorting purely on the client side.

## Current State

Filter controls are implemented as disabled UI elements with "coming soon" tooltips to avoid dead clicks while indicating future functionality.

## 1. Invoice Object Schema
The marketplace currently maps to the following object structure. The hook expects this exact shape when performing derived state calculations.

### 1. Yield Range Filter

- **Purpose**: Filter invoices by yield percentage range
- **Future API Contract**: `GET /api/invoices?yield_min=5&yield_max=10`
- **UI State**: Disabled with "coming soon" tooltip

### 2. Currency Filter

- **Purpose**: Filter invoices by currency type (USD, EUR, etc.)
- **Future API Contract**: `GET /api/invoices?currency=USD,EUR`
- **UI State**: Disabled with "coming soon" tooltip

### 3. Maturity Date Filter

- **Purpose**: Filter invoices by maturity date range
- **Future API Contract**: `GET /api/invoices?maturity_from=2026-06-01&maturity_to=2026-12-31`
- **UI State**: Disabled with "coming soon" tooltip

### 4. Sort Options

- **Purpose**: Sort invoices by various criteria
- **Future API Contract**: `GET /api/invoices?sort=yield_desc|amount_asc|maturity_asc`
- **UI State**: Disabled with "coming soon" tooltip

### 5. Clear Filters

- **Purpose**: Reset all applied filters
- **Future API Contract**: Reset to base `GET /api/invoices`
- **UI State**: Disabled with "coming soon" tooltip

## Accessibility Features

- All disabled buttons have proper `aria-label` attributes
- Tooltips are announced to screen readers
- Keyboard navigation is preserved (though buttons are disabled)
- High contrast design follows existing slate/cyan theme

## Responsive Design

- Filter controls wrap on smaller screens using `flex-wrap`
- Maintains proper spacing and layout across breakpoints
- Tooltips remain positioned correctly on mobile

## Implementation Notes

- Uses Tailwind CSS classes consistent with existing design system
- Follows slate-950/cyan-400 color scheme
- Implements hover states and transitions for better UX
- All controls are properly marked as disabled to prevent interaction

## Backend Integration Requirements

When implementing the backend:

1. Create API endpoints that support the query parameters above
2. Implement filtering logic on the invoice data
3. Add pagination support for large datasets
4. Consider caching for frequently accessed filter combinations
5. Validate filter parameters and return appropriate error responses

## Testing Checklist

- [x] Filter controls are visually disabled
- [x] "Coming soon" tooltips appear on hover
- [x] Responsive layout works on mobile
- [x] Accessibility labels are present
- [x] Color contrast meets WCAG standards
- [x] No console errors on page load
